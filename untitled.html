<div>Data analysis bootcamp is for all of you who have to work with data and work with data sets. This is a set of practical, hands-on training where you will learn how to work with shell, git, bash scripts, R, Rstudio, dplyr and ggplot2. After working through this set of tutorials, you will gain confidence to work with your own data sets.
