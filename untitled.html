<div>Data analysis bootcamp is for all of you who have to work with data and work with data sets. This is a set of practical, hands-on training where you will learn how to work with shell, git, bash scripts, R, Rstudio, dplyr and ggplot2. After working through this set of tutorials, you will gain confidence to work with your own data sets. If you feel stuck, please come back to revisit this page and ask questions. </div><div>We will cover the following topics:</div><ol><li>Basic shell commands</li><li>How to use git for version control</li><li>How to use OpenRefine for data cleaning and data preprocessing</li><li>Working with Rstudio for data analysis using tidydata, dplyr, and ggplot2 for data analysis and graphing</li><li>How to use lavaan for structural equation modelling</li><li>How to write your research using markdown/latex/overleaf/authorea</li><li>How to conduct meta analyses and systematic reviews</li></ol><h2 data-label="679074" class="ltx_title_subsection">Basic Shell commands</h2><div>Shell is a command line interface where you can issue instructions to your computer in plain text and you can get yoru work done. Depending on the kind of operating system you use, you will need to either install or learn to use a shell already bundled with your OS. </div><ul><li>For windows OS, use powershell or if you install git for windows you can use the gitbash that gets installed on your machine</li><li>For LInux and Mac OS, you get bash</li></ul><div>You can learn more about shell and practice if you follow the data/software carpentry exercise here:</div><div><a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro/" target="_blank">Software carpentry bash tutorial</a></div><div>If you are use Mac or Linux OS, then bash shell is already built in; if you use Windows, please <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/" target="_blank">follow the tutorial written by howtogeek.com to install bash shell on Windows 10</a>. If this will not work for you, then you can also download and install win-bash for windows. </div><div></div><div></div><div>How to use git for version control</div><div>How to use Openrefine for data preprocessing</div><div>How to use Rstudio and within Rstudio tidydata, dplyr, and ggplot2 for data analysis and graphics</div><div>How to use lavaan for structural equation modelling</div><div>How to write research using plain text and write preprints</div><div></div><div></div>
